# 1. Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

### **Patterns Overview**

- **[Abstract Factory](./Creational/Abstract_Factory.cpp)**  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5058b9c6-8163-44a7-8080-feda18f55406)  
  **Description**: Creates **families of related objects** (e.g., UI components for a specific OS) without specifying their concrete classes.  

- **[Builder](./Creational/Builder.cpp)**  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7a7c24-c860-4fc1-be2b-a3f9679fac65)  
  **Description**: Constructs **complex objects step-by-step**, separating construction logic from the object’s representation.  

- **[Factory Method](./Creational/Factory_Method.cpp)**  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2ca6208-953c-4ae7-9331-939929de3848)  
  **Description**: Delegates object creation to **subclasses** via a virtual constructor.  

- **[Prototype](./Creational/Prototype.cpp)**  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe6bcd08-1e83-40cb-8eab-9ff07862a421)  
  **Description**: Clones **pre-initialized instances** to avoid expensive initialization.  

- **[Singleton](./Creational/Singleton.cpp)**  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb2687cf-b62c-4e3e-a5c7-4098f1b0d2dd)  
  **Description**: Restricts a class to **one global instance**.

### **Pattern Comparison Table**

| Pattern          | Intent                                                                 | Key Features                                  | When to Use                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstract Factory** | Create families of related/dependent objects                        | Factory interfaces, product consistency      | Cross-platform UI, themed component kits         |
| **Builder**      | Build complex objects incrementally                                   | Step-by-step construction, fluent interface  | Objects with optional/configurable parts         |
| **Factory Method** | Let subclasses decide which class to instantiate                     | Virtual constructor, inheritance-based       | Decoupling client code from concrete classes     |
| **Prototype**    | Clone existing instances to avoid re-initialization                   | `clone()` method, prototype registry         | Costly object creation (e.g., database-heavy)    |
| **Singleton**    | Ensure a single global instance                                       | Private constructor, static access method    | Shared resources (e.g., config managers)         |

---

### **Why Each Pattern is Needed**

#### 1. **Singleton**
- **Necessity**: Centralizes access to shared resources (e.g., configuration managers, thread pools) to prevent duplicate instances and ensure consistent state.
- **Problem Solved**: Uncontrolled instantiation leading to resource contention or wasted memory.

#### 2. **Factory Method**
- **Necessity**: Decouples client code from concrete classes, allowing subclasses to define which objects to create (e.g., document editors supporting multiple formats).
- **Problem Solved**: Rigid code that directly depends on specific classes, making extensions difficult.

#### 3. **Abstract Factory**
- **Necessity**: Ensures compatibility among related products (e.g., UI components for a specific OS theme) without exposing their concrete classes.
- **Problem Solved**: Inconsistent product combinations (e.g., mixing "modern" and "classic" UI elements).

#### 4. **Builder**
- **Necessity**: Simplifies creation of objects with many optional parameters (e.g., SQL queries, HTTP requests) and avoids telescoping constructors.
- **Problem Solved**: Complex constructors with redundant parameters and poor readability.

#### 5. **Prototype**
- **Necessity**: Optimizes performance by cloning pre-initialized instances (e.g., game enemies with shared AI logic) instead of reinitializing from scratch.
- **Problem Solved**: Expensive object creation due to resource-heavy initialization (e.g., database calls).

## When to Use Which Pattern?
- Use **Singleton** for global access to a single instance.  
- Use **Factory Method** when subclassing determines the object type.  
- Use **Abstract Factory** for creating entire product families.  
- Use **Builder** to handle complex object assembly with optional steps.  
- Use **Prototype** to avoid costly initialization via cloning.

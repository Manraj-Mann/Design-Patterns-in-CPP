/*
    Intent : Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
    
    Consequences : 
    
    - Provides hooks for subclasses.
    - Connects parallel class hierarchies. Parallel class hierarchies result when a class delegates some ofits responsibilities to a separate class.
    
    Implementation : 
    
    - Factory methods in C++ are always virtual functions and are often pure virtual. Justbe careful not to call factory methods in the Creator's constructorâ€” the factory method in the ConcreteCreatorwon't be available yet.
    - Instead of creating the product in the constructor,the constructor merely initializes it to 0. The accessor returns the product. Butfirst it checksto make sure the product exists, and if it doesn't, the accessor creates it. This technique is sometimes called lazy initialization. 
    - Using templates to avoid subclassing
    
    Related Patterns : 
    
    - Abstract Factory is often implemented with factory methods. 
    - Factory methods are usually called within Template Methods.
    - Prototypes don't require subclassing Creator. However, they often require an Initialize operation on the Product class.Creator uses Initialize to initialize the object. Factory Method doesn't require such an operation.
